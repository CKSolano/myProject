          <h1>(STAGE 0) Getting started with HTML</h1>
          <p><b><em>< >:</em></b> These are called tags and are used
          for html elements.Mostly all elements <br>have an
          opening and closing tag. A closing tag always closes with <b> / </b> in between
          <br> the brackets. <br>
          <em> opening tag = </em> < body>
          <br> <em>closing tag = </em> < /body></p>

          <h2> html elements!</h2>
          <p> in <b>html</b> there are two types of elements. they are <em><b>in-line</b></em> elements which is used<br> just for text
          and <em><b> block </b></em> elements which is literally a box rendered around the <br>text or content, which can be styled with CSS.</p>

          <p><b><em>!DOCTYPE html: </em></b> This is the very first line on every webpage made. It defines the<br> type of document it is so
          the browser can render it correctly.</p>

          <p><b><em>html:</em></b> Hyper Text Markup Language. It surrounds the whole document with an open tag at the top and closing tag at the bottom
          of the document.</p>

          <p><b><em>head:</em></b> this is the head element and is place right under the html opening tag   <br> when starting your code document.
          The <b>head </b> element has meta data, title, and style elements, and javascript etc.</p>

          <p><b><em> body:</em></b> this is the body element and it contains all the content that is rendered into a webpage in a browser.</p>

          <p><b><em>b:</em></b> the b element is used to make text appear bold.</p>

          <p><b><em>br:</em></b> this element creates a line break in a sentence or paragraph.</p>

          <p><b><em> em: </em></b> the em element is used to make text appear <em>italicized</em></p>

          <p><b><em> a:  </em></b>this is a anchor element and it is used to LINK anything to a URL.</p>

          <p><b><em> img: </em></b> this is the image element and is used to add an image to your web page. </p>

          <p><b><em> h1: </em></b> is usually the header of a page, paragraph, and or topic and the text are <br>
          bolder and bigger. There are usually six different headers used as h1, h2, h3, and so on.</p>

          <p><b><em> p: </em></b> this is the paragraph element and is used for writing sentences and/or paragraphs.</p>

          <p><b><em> span:</em></b> this is the span element and its considered an<b> in-line</b> type element. It creates an <b>in-line</b> container element.</p>

          <p>Familiarize the <b>tree like structure</b> of a web page.</p>


          <p>HTML and CSS are both "languages"</p>

          <p>HTML controls the "structure" of a web page</p>

          <p>CSS controls the "style" of a page (how it looks).</p>

          <p>When programmers talk about the "DOM" (Document Object Model) they are talking about the tree-like structure of a page.</p>

          <h1>(Stage 1) MAKE A WEB PAGE</h1>

          <h1>HTML-CSS-DOM</h1>

          <p><b>HTML -<em> HyperText Markup Language</em></b> - the standard markup language used to create web pages.</p>

          <p><b>CSS <em>- Cascading Style Sheets </em></b>- style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language.</p>

          <p><b>DOM <em> - Document Object Model</em></b> - a cross-platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML (and other markup languages). The nodes of every document are organized in a tree structure, called the DOM tree.</p>

          <p><b><em>Cascading</em></b> means that rules are applied not only to the elements they directly match, but also to all of those elements' child elements.</p>

          <p><b><em>Rule:</em></b> a line of CSS code describing the value that a certain attribute should take.</p>

          <p><b><em>Property:</em></b> The property you want to change.</p>

          <p><b><em>Value:</em></b> The value that you want to assign to the attribute.</p>

          <p><b><em>Selector: </em></b>The name that you use to in order to target the elements that are assigned to a class or id attribute in the HTML.</p>

          <p><b><em>Class:</em></b> A class refers to a group of elements that can be styled together. Class names should not contain periods or any other punctuation marks such as class="1.1"</p>

        <p><b><em>ID:</em></b> ID's are unique identifiers that uniquely identifies an element in HTML.</p>

        <h2>THE BOX MODEL</h2>
          <p>All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.</p>

          <p>The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. The image below illustrates the box model</p>


          <img src="http://www.scheiner.cc/images/blog/boxmodel.png" width="35%" alt="The Box Model">


          <p><b>Content - </b>The content of the box, where text and images appear</p>

          <p><b>Padding - </b>Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent</p>

          <p><b>Border - </b>A border that goes around the padding and content</p>


          <p><b>Margin - </b>Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent</p>


          <p>The box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements. </p>

        <h4>BOX SIZING</h4>
          <p>There are two techniques you can use to help deal with sizing issues:</p>
           <p> 1. Set sizes in terms of percentages rather than pixels.</p>
           <p> 2. Set the box-sizing attribute to border-box for every element</p>


        <h4>BOX POSITIONING</h4>
            <p>1. Divs are block elements (as opposed to inline), so by default they take up the entire width of a page.</p>
            <p>2. Adding the rule display: flex; to the appropriate CSS will override this behavior and let divs appear next to each other.</p>
